# SpaceX Falcon 9 Data Science Capstone

## Overview
This project is part of the **Data Science Capstone** and utilizes **SpaceX Falcon 9** data to perform various tasks, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning predictions. The goal is to analyze and predict launch outcomes using historical data from SpaceX launches.

## Repository Structure
- **1_SpaceX_data-collection-api.ipynb**: Collects SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data via an API.
- **2_SpaceX_webscraping.ipynb**: Web scraping techniques to gather additional SpaceX data from public websites.
- **3_SpaceX_Data_wrangling.ipynb**: Cleans and processes the raw data for further analysis.
- **4_SpaceX_eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and SQL queries using SQLite.
- **5_SpaceX_eda-data-viz.ipynb**: Visualizing the data to extract meaningful insights.
- **6_SpaceX_launch_site_location.ipynb**: Analysis of SpaceX launch site locations and their significance.
- **7_SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction.ipynb**: Building a machine learning model to predict the outcome of SpaceX launches.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Purpose
The project aims to explore the relationship between various factors such as launch location, vehicle type, and historical performance to predict the success or failure of future launches. It also highlights the use of modern data science techniques, including **data wrangling**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **machine learning models**.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (SQLite)
- **APIs** (SpaceX API)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
